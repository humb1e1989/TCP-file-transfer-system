# TCP-file-transfer-system
> This project is a comprehensive network engineering project with the goal of implementing a secure and efficient file transfer system through Software Defined Networking **(SDN)** and **TCP/IP** protocols. The system is capable of handling user authorization, file encryption, direct and redirected file transfers, as well as monitoring and evaluation of network performance.
