## Implementation details

### 1. User Authorization and File Encryption

**_MD5 Encryption:_** <br>
> The system employs MD5 encryption algorithms to secure user account passwords, establishing a robust authorization mechanism.

**_Token Feature:_**
> A ‚Äútoken‚Äù feature is integrated to enhance the accuracy of user authorization.

**_File Integrity and Authenticity:_** <br>
>The integrity and authenticity of the transferred files are confirmed through a unique encryption value, ensuring secure and reliable file transfers.

### 2. Software Defined Networking (SDN)

_**Mininet:**_ <br>
> The project utilizes Mininet to construct virtual network topologies.

_**Ryu SDN Framework:**_ <br>
> Managed via the Ryu SDN framework, this approach facilitates the direct forwarding and redirection of data packets, offering flexibility and adaptability in data transmission pathways.

### 3. File Transfer Protocol

_**Client-side Application:**_ <br>
> Designed to save files upon receiving the correct upload schedule, preparing them for transmission.

_**Upload Initiation Time:**_ <br>
> The initiation time of the upload is recorded using Python‚Äôs ‚Äúperf counter()‚Äù function.

_**Information Packaging:**_ <br>
> Essential information, including ‚Äúkey,‚Äù ‚Äúblock-index,‚Äù ‚Äútoken,‚Äù and ‚Äúbin-data,‚Äù is packaged and sent to the server to execute the file transfer.

## 4. Network Performance Evaluation

_**Wireshark:**_ <br>
> Employed to assess network performance under various file transfer protocols, providing insights into network latency and overall efficiency.

_**Performance Tests:**_ <br>
> Comprehensive performance tests validate the system‚Äôs efficiency and stability, confirming its readiness for real-world application.
